  body: " _Changes since **Alpha 3913.0.0**_\r\n \r\n #### Security fixes:\r\n \r\n\
    \ - Downgraded xz-utils to 5.4.2 as precaution even though Flatcar is not affected\
    \ of the SSH backdoor ([CVE-2024-3094](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094))\r\
    \n - c-ares ([CVE-2024-25629](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25629))\r\
    \n - coreutils ([coreutils-2024-03-28](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2024-03/msg00006.html))\r\
    \n - curl ([CVE-2024-2004](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2004), [CVE-2024-2379](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2379),\
    \ [CVE-2024-2398](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2398), [CVE-2024-2466](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2466))\r\

    \n \r\n #### Bug fixes:\r\n \r\n - Disabled user-configdrive.service on OpenStack\
    \ when config drive is used, which caused the hostname to be overwritten. The\
    \ coreos-cloudinit.service unit already runs on OpenStack if the system is not\
    \ configured via ignition. ([Flatcar#1385](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1385))\r\
    \n - Fixed `toolbox` to prevent mounted `ctr` snapshots from being garbage-collected\
    \ ([toolbox#9](https://github.com/flatcar/toolbox/pull/9))\r\n \r\n #### Changes:\r\
    \n \r\n - Added zram-generator package to the image ([scripts#1772](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1772))\r\

    \n - Added support for unlocking the rootfs with a TPM set up by systemd-cryptenroll\
    \ ([bootengine#93](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/93))\r\n - Disabled\
    \ real-time priority for multipathd as it prevents the cgroups2 cpu controller\
    \ from working. ([flatcar/scripts#1771](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1771))\r\
    \n - Enabled amd-pstate,amd-pstate-epp cpufreq drivers for some AMD CPUs in the\
    \ kernel. ([flatcar/scripts#1770](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1770))\r\
    \n - Enabled ntpd by default on AWS & GCP, enabled chronyd by default on Azure.\
    \ The native time sync source is used on each cloud. ([scripts#1792](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1792))\r\
    \n   - Enabled the ptp_vmw module in the kernel.\r\n   - Switched ptp_kvm from\
    \ kernel builtin to module.\r\n - Enabled the GRUB TPM2 module to measure the\
    \ boot code path and files into PCR 8+9 in UEFI ([scripts#1861](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1861))\r\
    \n - Hyper-V images, both .vhd and .vhdx files are available as `zip` compressed,\
    \ switching from `bzip2` to a built-in available Windows compression - `zip` ([scripts#1878](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1878))\r\
    \n - OpenStack, Brightbox: Added the `flatcar.autologin` kernel cmdline parameter\
    \ by default as the hypervisor manages access to the console ([scripts#1866](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1866))\r\
    \n - Removed `actool` from the image and `acbuild` from the SDK as these tools\
    \ are deprecated and not used ([scripts#1817](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1817))\r\
    \n - SDK: Unified qemu image formats, so that the `qemu_uefi` build target provides\
    \ the regular `qemu` and the `qemu_uefi_secure` artifacts ([scripts#1847](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1847))\r\
    \n - The default VM memory was bumped to 2 GB in the Qemu script and for VMware\
    \ OVFs ([scripts#1827](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1827))\r\n \r\n\
