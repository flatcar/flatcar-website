  body: "**This release removes the legacy \"torcx\" image customisation and replaces\
    \ this feature with systemd-sysext. Torcx enabled users to deploy custom docker\
    \ versions; however, it required special packaging using the Flatcar SDK.** Please\
    \ refer to the \"Changes\" section below for details.\r\n\r\n**This release ships\
    \ a major Docker update: Docker was upgraded to version 24 (from version 20 in\
    \ the previous release). Please see the \"Changes\" section below for details.**\r\
    \n\r\n _Changes since **Alpha 3760.0.0**_\r\n \r\n #### Security fixes:\r\n \r\
    \n - Linux ([CVE-2023-35827](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35827),\
    \ [CVE-2023-46813](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46813), [CVE-2023-46862](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46862),\
    \ [CVE-2023-5178](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5178), [CVE-2023-5717](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5717))\r\
    \n - VMWare: open-vm-tools ([CVE-2023-34058](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34058),\
    \ [CVE-2023-34059](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34059))\r\n - nghttp2\
    \ ([CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487))\r\n - samba\
    \ ([CVE-2023-4091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4091))\r\n - zlib\
    \ ([CVE-2023-45853](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45853))\r\n \r\n\
    \ #### Bug fixes:\r\n \r\n - Fixed iterating over the OEM update payload signatures\
    \ which prevented the AWS OEM update to 3745.x.y ([update-engine#31](https://github.com/flatcar/update_engine/pull/31))\r\
    \n - Made `sshkeys.service` more robust to only run `coreos-metadata-sshkeys@core.service`\
    \ when not masked and also retry on failure ([init#112](https://github.com/flatcar/init/pull/112))\r\
    \n - Set TTY used for fetching server_context to RAW mode before running cloudinit\
    \ on cloudsigma ([scripts#1280](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1280))\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n #### Known issues:\r\n\r\n- docker and containerd packages information\
    \ are missing from `flatcar_production_image_packages.txt` ([flatcar#1260](https://github.com/flatcar/Flatcar/issues/1260))\r\
    \n \r\n #### Changes:\r\n    \r\n - **Torcx, the mechanism to provide a custom\
    \ Docker version, was replaced by systemd-sysext in the OS image**. Learn more\
    \ about sysext and how to customise OS images [here](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/provisioning/sysext/).\r\
    \n   - Torcx entered deprecation 2 years ago in favour of [deploying plain Docker\
    \ binaries](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/container-runtimes/use-a-custom-docker-or-containerd-version/)\r\
    \n    (which is now also a legacy option because systemd-sysext offers a more\
    \ robust and better structured way of customisation, including OS independent\
    \ updates).\r\n   - Torcx has been removed entirely; if you use Torcx to extend\
    \ the Flatcar base OS image, please refer to our [conversion script](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/provisioning/sysext/#torcx-deprecation)\
    \ and to the sysext documentation mentioned above for migrating.\r\n   - Consequently,\
    \ `update_engine` will not perform torcx sanity checks post-update anymore.\r\n\
    \   - Relevant changes: [scripts#1216](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1216),\
    \ [update_engine#30](https://github.com/flatcar/update_engine/pull/30), [Mantle#466](https://github.com/flatcar/mantle/pull/466),\
    \ [Mantle#465](https://github.com/flatcar/mantle/pull/465).\r\n- cri-tools, runc,\
    \ containerd, docker, and docker-cli are now built from Gentoo upstream ebuilds.\
    \ Docker received a major version upgrade - it was updated to Docker 24 (from\
    \ Docker 20; see \"updates\").\r\n  - **NOTE:** The docker btrfs storage driver\
    \ has been de-prioritised; BTRFS backed storage will now default to the `overlay2`\
    \ driver\r\n    ([changelog](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/23.0/#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-6),\
    \ [upstream pr](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/42661)).\r\n    Using the btrfs\
    \ driver can still be enforced by creating a respective [docker config](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/btrfs-driver/#configure-docker-to-use-the-btrfs-storage-driver)\
    \ at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.\r\n  - **NOTE:** If you are already using btrfs-backed\
    \ Docker storage and are upgrading to this new version, Docker will automatically\
    \ use the `btrfs` storage driver for backwards-compatibility with your deployment.\r\
    \n    - **Docker will remove the `btrfs` driver entirely in a future version.\
    \ Please consider migrating your deployments to the `overlay2` driver.**\r\n -\
    \ Brightbox: The regular OpenStack image should now be used, it includes Afterburn\
    \ for instance metadata attributes\r\n - OpenStack: An uncompressed image is provided\
    \ for simpler import (since the images use qcow2 inline compression, there is\
    \ no benefit in using the `.gz` or `.bz2` images)\r\n\r\n #### Updates:\r\n \r\
