  body: " _Changes since **Alpha 3975.0.0**_\r\n \r\n #### Bug fixes:\r\n \r\n - Fixed\
    \ issue file generation from `/etc/issue.d` ([scripts#2018](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/2018))\r\
    \n \r\n #### Changes:\r\n \r\n - Added Akamai / Linode images ([flatcar/scripts#1806](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1806))\r\
    \n - Provided a Python Flatcar extension as optional systemd-sysext image with\
    \ the release. Write 'python' to `/etc/flatcar/enabled-sysext.conf` through Ignition\
    \ and the sysext will be installed during provisioning ([scripts#1979](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1979))\r\
    \n - OpenStack: Changed metadata hostname source order. The service first tries\
    \ with the config drive then fallback on the metadata service. ([bootengine#96](https://github.com/flatcar/bootengine/pull/96))\r\
    \n - Removed unused grub executable duplicate files and removed grub modules that\
    \ are already assembled in the grub executable ([scripts#1955](https://github.com/flatcar/scripts/pull/1955)).\r\
    \n - libcrypt is now provided by the libxcrypt library instead of glibc. Glibc\
    \ libcrypt was deprecated long time ago.\r\n \r\n #### Updates:\r\n \r\n - Ignition\
    \ ([2.19.0](https://coreos.github.io/ignition/release-notes/#ignition-2190-2024-06-05))\r\
    \n - Linux ([6.6.35](https://lwn.net/Articles/979262) (includes [6.6.34](https://lwn.net/Articles/978593),\
    \ [6.6.33](https://lwn.net/Articles/978141), [6.6.32](https://lwn.net/Articles/975075)\
    \ and [6.6.31](https://lwn.net/Articles/974072)))\r\n - Linux Firmware ([20240610](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tag/?h=20240610))\r\
    \n - Rust ([1.79.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.79.0) (includes\
    \ [1.78.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.78.0)))\r\n - afterburn\
    \ ([5.6.0](https://coreos.github.io/afterburn/release-notes/#afterburn-560))\r\
    \n - ca-certificates ([3.101](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/releases/nss_3_101.html))\r\
    \n - containerd ([1.7.18](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.7.18))"
