As we close out 2025 and look forward to the next chapter for Flatcar Container Linux, we want to take a moment to acknowledge a partner that played a defining role in the project’s growth: Equinix Metal. 

Flatcar’s relationship with what would become Equinix Metal stretches back through the project’s early years, all the way to its work with Packet, a developer‑friendly bare metal cloud provider. Packet’s infrastructure was a natural fit for Flatcar’s early build, test, and image hosting needs.

In early 2020, Equinix announced its acquisition of Packet, folding Packet’s tooling and team into what became Equinix Metal. That transition didn’t interrupt the support we received, if anything, it amplified it. The donated bare metal resources and engineering collaboration continued seamlessly under Equinix Metal, making an immediate impact on Flatcar’s infrastructure.

Flatcar’s build and test infrastructure relied on that support for years, running CI pipelines, release infrastructure, global image servers, caches, and vendor-specific test environments. The partnership helped us keep our focus where it mattered: on the operating system and the community.

One of the clearest perspectives on Equinix Metal’s impact comes from the people who lived the day-to-day life of keeping Flatcar running. Flatcar maintainer, Mathieu Tortuyaux, summed it up simply, “From a maintainer perspective, I can surely say that Flatcar wouldn't be what it is today without the Equinix Metal sponsorship.”

This continuity of support, from Packet’s bare metal roots through the evolution into Equinix Metal, freed the Flatcar community to innovate, build reproducible pipelines, and deliver reliable releases around the world.

### A Shared Success Story

Flatcar has always been a community project which as built by contributors across companies, time zones, and backgrounds. But even the strongest communities rely on the infrastructure behind the scenes: the machines that build kernels, run tests, publish images, and keep automatic updates flowing smoothly.

For years, Equinix provided that backbone.

(perhaps we can get a quote from the Equinix team here?)

Even though our technical home is changing, our appreciation isn’t. Equinix helped Flatcar grow from a friendly fork into a CNCF incubating project with global reach, predictable releases, and a thriving user base. That impact will continue into the future.

### Thank You
To everyone at Equinix, from engineers, program managers, and the team who made this sponsorship possible, thank you. Your support helped Flatcar stay reliable, steady and community driven.

We’re excited for what comes next, and deeply grateful for the chapter we wrote together.
