### 1. Google Fonts

Our Sites use the service Google Fonts by Google to display optimized external fonts.

When you access our Sites, a connection to Google is established from which Google can identify the websites from which the request has been sent and to which IP address the fonts are being transmitted for display. Google Fonts does not set any cookies and your requests for fonts are separate from and do not contain any credentials you send to google.com while using other Google services that are authenticated, such as Gmail.

The legal basis for the processing of the data mentioned above is Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The purpose of the processing also constitutes the legitimate interest to provide you with optimized fonts.

### 2. Awesome Fonts

We use the service Awesome Fonts, provided by Fonticons, Inc., for the uniform display of fonts. When you visit a website, your browser caches the required web fonts to display text and fonts correctly. If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.

For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to the servers of Fonticons, Inc. This allows Fonticons, Inc. to know that your IP address has been used to access our website. The use of web fonts is in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest in the sense of Art. 6 par. 1 lit. f) DSGVO.
