title: i18n Internationalization / Localization
linkTitle: Internationalization
---

Nebraska's internationalization uses the i18next, i18next-parser, and
react-i18next libraries.

## Default language, and locales

We started with an international English, and that will be the fallback language.

Now we're starting with locales familiar, and will accept
translations through github.

## Browser based language detection

We use
[i18next-browser-languagedetector](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector#readme)

This can select the browser language through various means like through
cookies, the html language tag and other ways.

One way to change the locale is to use `?lng=en` in the URL.

## Lazy load locale files

Dynamic imports and the webpack code splitting feature we
load locale files from `src/js/i18n/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json`
where {{lng}} is the language code, and {{ns}} is the namespace.
