This section introduces some concepts for contributing translations, and is
especially important when submitting a new language.

**Important:** If you are adding a new language, keep in mind that while all
the specific Kubernetes components' names are translatable, it doesn't mean
that all of them should have a corresponding name in your language. Please,
refer to the [Kubernetes localized docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) in
your language (if they exist) in order to understand which components should
be translated and which should be left in the original form.

## Namespaces

[i18next namespaces](https://www.i18next.com/principles/namespaces)
are useful to keep things modular.

We have a namespace for each app section, and also some frequently used global parts.
Namespaces are separated from the actual text by a `|` character.
E.g. `t('mynamescapce|This will be the translated text')`.

### Frequent, and Glossary namespaces

Additionally we have some global namespaces for frequently used and
jargony technical words.

- frequent.json, Phrases reused many times, eg. 'save', 'cancel'
- glossary.json, Reusing these consistently inside texts like jargon words (Pods)

#### Technical Jargon words

For some technical/jargon terms there often isn't a good translation for
them. To find these ones, it can be good to look at existing documentation
like the k8s docs.

The word "Pods" is a good example of a technical word that is used in Spanish.
Maybe it could directly translate to "Vainas", but "Pods" is used instead.

## Number formatting

Numbers are formatted in a locale specific way. For example in 'en'
they are formatted like `1,000,000` but with 'de' they are formatted
like `1.000.000`.

Here is an example which can use number formatting:


```JavaScript
    return t('cluster|{{numReady, number}} / {{numItems, number}} Requested', {
      numReady: podsReady.length,
      numItems: items.length,
    });
```

Number formatting is being done with [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

## Date formatting

Here's an example of using date formatting:

```Javascript
    return t('appsection|When {{ date, date }}', {
      date: new Date(),
    });
```

## Adding a new component.

See the `frontend/src/js/i18n/locales/en/` folder for a complete list of namespaces.
If you need a new namespace (e.g. when you're using a sentence that's very specific to
a single/new component), use that namespace as you would if it already existed.

Then run `make i18n` and a new translation file for that namespace will show up in
all locale folders.

## Adding a new language.

Create a folder using the locale code in: `frontend/src/js/i18n/locales/`.

Then run `make i18n`. This command parses the translatable strings in
the project and creates the corresponding catalog files.

Integrated components may need to be adjusted (MaterialUI/Monaco etc).

## Material UI

Some Material UI components are localized, and are configured
via a theme provider.

See the Material UI
[Localization Guide](https://material-ui.com/guides/localization/),
and also `frontend/src/js/i18n/ThemeProviderNexti18n.tsx` where integration is done.
