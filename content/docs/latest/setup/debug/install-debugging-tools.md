You can use common debugging tools like tcpdump or strace with Toolbox. Using the filesystem of a specified Docker container Toolbox will launch a container with full system privileges including access to system PIDs, network interfaces and other global information. Inside of the toolbox, the machine's filesystem is mounted to `/media/root`.

## Quick debugging

By default, Toolbox uses the stock Fedora Docker container. To start using it, simply run:

```shell
/usr/bin/toolbox
```

_NOTE_: For Fedora, it's recommended to use at least 2048 MB RAM to avoid the following `dnf` operation being killed by the OOM manager.

You're now in the namespace of Fedora and can install any software you'd like via `dnf`. For example, if you'd like to use `tcpdump`:

```shell
[root@srv-3qy0p ~]# dnf -y install tcpdump
[root@srv-3qy0p ~]# tcpdump -i ens3
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
```

### Specify a custom Docker image

Create a `.toolboxrc` in the user's home folder to use a specific Docker image:

```shell
$ cat .toolboxrc
TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE=index.example.com/debug
TOOLBOX_USER=root
$ /usr/bin/toolbox
Pulling repository index.example.com/debug
...
```

You can also specify this in a Butane Config:

```yaml
variant: flatcar
version: 1.0.0
storage:
  files:
    - path: /home/core/.toolboxrc
      mode: 0644
      contents:
        inline: |
          TOOLBOX_DOCKER_IMAGE=index.example.com/debug
          TOOLBOX_DOCKER_TAG=v1
          TOOLBOX_USER=root
```

## Under the hood

Behind the scenes, `toolbox` downloads, prepares and exports the container
image you specify (or the default `fedora` image), then creates a container
from that extracted image by calling `systemd-nspawn`.  The exported
image is retained in
`/var/lib/toolbox/[username]-[image name]-[image tag]`, e.g. the default
image run by the `core` user is at `/var/lib/toolbox/core-fedora-latest`.  

This means two important things:

* Changes made inside the container will persist between sessions
* The container filesystem will take up space on disk (a few hundred MiB
for the default `fedora` container)

## Spawn a toolbox with tmux in the background

Since `toolbox` can only be started once it is not straightforward to use `tmux`
for long-running jobs or sharing a debugging session with someone else.

To keep user processes running in the background after logging out with SSH,
you need to start them via `systemd-run` because _process lingering_ is disabled
by default in logind and all non-service user processes are killed on logout.
Spawn a user service to persist the toolbox container with the `tmux` process
even when you log out with SSH.
The following command line will ensure `tmux`, `strace` and `pidof` are installed
in the container, then create a new `tmux` session to which you can later attach,
and keep the service active by waiting with `strace` until the `tmux` process exits.

```shell
systemd-run --user toolbox sh -c 'dnf install -y tmux strace procps-ng; TERM=tmux tmux new-session -d -s sharedsession; strace -p "$(pidof tmux)"'
```

With `-d` we tell `tmux` to not allocate a TTY now (needed for `systemd-run`) but run a
new session in the background.
Because `tmux` forks away, we cannot use `wait` in the shell to wait for children but need
to use `strace` to have a foreground process running that prevents `toolbox` from quitting.

Once this is running you can can attach to the `tmux` session as often as you want from any SSH connection.

```shell
sudo nsenter -t "$(pidof tmux | cut -d ' ' -f 1)" -a tmux a
```

As usual with `tmux` you can attach and detach to the session as many times as you want because detaching
still keeps `tmux` running in the background. But keep in mind that if you exit the session, the process
started with `systemd-run` will terminate and you'll have to start the service again with `systemd-run`.

## SSH directly into a toolbox

Advanced users can SSH directly into a toolbox by setting up an `/etc/passwd` entry:

```shell
useradd bob -m -p '*' -s /usr/bin/toolbox -U -G sudo,docker,rkt
```

To test, SSH as bob:

```shell
ssh bob@hostname.example.com

## Early boot debugging over console

When you need an interactive shell inside the initramfs before the system boots (for example to inspect units or mounts before systemd starts userspace), you can drop into rd.break and direct all I/O to the serial console only.

This kernel command line disables VGA output and uses the serial port as the sole interactive console:

```
rd.break rd.shell rd.debug loglevel=7 console=ttyS0,115200n8 earlycon=ttyS0,115200 systemd.show_status=yes systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=console
```

Notes:
- Only specify a single console= to ensure the serial port is the exclusive input console. If your platform injects console=tty0 by default, remove it so the display is not used.
- Replace ttyS0,115200n8 with the device/speed appropriate for your platform:
  - PC/QEMU (16550A): ttyS0,115200n8 (earlycon=ttyS0,115200)
  - Virtio console: hvc0 (earlycon=hvc0; speed not required)
  - Many ARM platforms: ttyAMA0,115200 (earlycon=ttyAMA0,115200)
- Some cloud providers (e.g., Scaleway) require that you explicitly configure the instance to expose the serial console and that you pass the correct console= parameter for their environment. Consult the providerâ€™s documentation for the exact device name.
- rd.break opens a shell in the initramfs; rd.shell also drops you to a shell if the initramfs hits an error. rd.debug and loglevel=7 increase verbosity. systemd.show_status=yes and systemd.log_target=console print systemd status and logs to the console early, which is particularly useful when services fail to start without visible errors on the default console.
- Security: these options yield an unauthenticated root shell in early boot. Remove them once you have finished debugging.

Switching between serial and VGA:
- Serial-only (disable VGA): use a single console= pointing to the serial port (as shown above).
- VGA-only (no serial input): use console=tty0.
- Mirror output to both but keep serial interactive: list both consoles and put serial last (the last console= receives input):
  ```
  ... console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8
  ```
  Put tty0 last if you want the keyboard/display to be interactive instead.

Verifying the active console and TTY:
- Effective kernel cmdline: `cat /proc/cmdline`
- Active kernel consoles: `cat /sys/class/tty/console/active`
- Current TTY in the shell: `tty`
- Boot-time console messages: `dmesg | grep -i console`

This approach is helpful when debugging early-boot issues (e.g., systemd units that do not start and do not report errors on the default console). By forcing rd.break on the serial console with maximum verbosity, you can interactively inspect the environment before the root pivot and service start-up.
