_Please note that Proxmox VE is not an officially supported platform at this time because the release tests don't run for it._

These instructions will walk you through running Flatcar Container Linux on Proxmox VE.

## Choosing a channel

Flatcar Container Linux is designed to be updated automatically with different schedules per channel. You can [disable this feature][update-strategies], although we don't recommend it. Read the [release notes][release-notes] for specific features and bug fixes.

## Creating the VM

Proxmox VE graphical UI only supports ISO images, but the Flatcar image is in qcow2 format.
In order to create a VM with our image, we'll need to use the command line on the Proxmox host.

```bash
export VM_ID=123

# create the vm and import the image to it's disk
qm create $VM_ID --cores 2 --memory 4096 --net0 "virtio,bridge=vmbr0" --ipconfig0 "ip=dhcp"
qm disk import $VM_ID flatcar_production_proxmoxve_image.img local-lvm

# tell the vm to boot from the imported image
qm set $VM_ID --scsi0 local-lvm:vm-$VM_ID-disk-0
qm set $VM_ID --boot order=scsi0

# Create the cloud-init CD-ROM drive which activates the cloud-init options for the VM.
# This is required for using ignition config as well.
qm set $VM_ID --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit
```

## Configuring the VM with OpenStack-style cloud-init config

Our VM can be booted as-is, however we might want to add a cloud-init configuration.

Select the VM, then go to Hardware and click Add > CloudInit Drive. You can then edit the config from the Cloud-Init tab.

What is supported:

- Setting hostname (hostname is always `$VM_ID`)
- Writing SSH keys
- Writing network configuration


## Configuring the VM using Ignition

> **Important note**: Ignition configuration uses the same `user-data` file than the cloud-init config. This means that you cannot use both Ignition config and regular cloud-init. When setting up an Ignition config, expect the cloud-init services to fail during boot (this is harmless).

Proxmox VE graphical interface does not support setting a custom user-data file. You'll need to use the command line to achieve this.

First of all we need to write the Ignition config as as snippet. Snippets are located at `/var/lib/vz/snippets` on the hypervisor. Write a file named `user-data` containing your Ignition config. Here is an example :

```bash
cat /var/lib/vz/snippets/user-data

{
  "ignition": { "version": "3.0.0" },
  "storage": {
    "files": [{
      "path": "/etc/someconfig",
      "mode": 420,
      "contents": { "source": "data:,example%20file%0A" }
    }]
  },
  "passwd": {
    "users": [
      {
        "name": "core",
        "sshAuthorizedKeys": [
          "ssh-ed25519 your-public-ssh-key"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Finally, tell the VM to use this file as `user-data` :

```bash
qm set $VM_ID --cicustom "user=local:snippets/user-data"
```

## Using Flatcar Container Linux

Now that you have a machine booted it is time to play around. Check out the [Flatcar Container Linux Quickstart][quickstart] guide or dig into [more specific topics][doc-index].
