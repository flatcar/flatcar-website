This section is aimed at curious developers interested in building Flatcar Container Linux from source and/or in modifying the OS.
We provide a containerised SDK that allows you to extend Flatcar and to build your own OS images.
We also provide OEM functionality for cloud providers and similar use cases to customize Flatcar Container Linux to run within their environment.
